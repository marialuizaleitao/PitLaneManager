## Prototyping with Figma

The initial UI/UX design for PitLane Manager was prototyped using Figma. Figma allowed for easy collaboration and iteration during the design phase. It provided a comprehensive platform for wireframing, designing, and prototyping the application's user interface. By using Figma, we were able to visualize and refine the design before starting development, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly end product.
